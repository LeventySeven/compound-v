# skills-audit.sh — which skills actually FIRE in real sessions.

# trigger-eval.sh measures SYNTHETIC routing: hand-written fixtures, one cold turn each.
# This measures REAL routing — it counts Skill tool invocations in your own local Claude Code
# transcripts. Cold routing vs. warm routing are different questions and you need both.

#   bash scripts/skills-audit.sh                 # last 90 days

#
# READ-ONLY, and it must stay that way. This is ONE machine's usage; what ships goes to
# everyone. Wiring an auto-archive to this number would take a global decision on a
# single-user signal. Nothing here writes to skills/.
#
# Two traps it exists to not fall into. Both have already produced a confidently wrong
# report about this kit:
#   1. Names appear BOTH namespaced ("compound-v:evals") and bare ("evals"). A bare name
#      means a personal-level copy is shadowing the plugin (see the install note in
#      README.md). Count only the prefixed form and you undercount — sometimes to zero.
#   2. A zero is absence of evidence, not evidence of death. Opt-in skills say "do not
#      auto-trigger" in their own description, so their zero is compliance. Flagged as such.
#
# Honest limit: --days filters on file MTIME, which is per-file, so a long-lived session file
# counts wholly inside the window. Read a windowed count as an upper bound on recency.
# Per-invocation token cost is NOT reported: a Skill call's tokens are not separable from its
# turn in the transcript. The two size columns are the skill's own cost instead.
#
# No dependencies (find/grep/sed/awk/sort). Slow by nature — it reads a multi-GB corpus, so
# it belongs in a terminal, never in check.sh or a pre-commit hook.
#
# Exit 0 = report printed. Exit 2 = nothing to measure (never a silent table of zeros).
